# About the project
This project actually my final project in digital image processing course. This project is about roof based mobile robot localization utilizing image processing technique. If you want to develop this program, please feel free to use it. I release the project under GNU/GPL.

# Visual Mobile Robot Localization
The idea of visual mobile robot localization is to determine the position of a robot in the defined position by utilizing camera that captures the roof image on the top of the robot. We give four color marks on the roof and the position is inferred from the color marks location.

# Required library
The program developed in Visual Studio and required some libraries
* Open CV
* Visual C++ .NET
